# An Ergonomic Skin for Delta

# Overview
I wasn't satisfied with the original Delta skin so I tried to find a more ergonomic skin to fit the Game I wanted to play... Since I didn't find anything that fit my liking, I make one myself.

# How to get setup
Download  the `.deltaskin` file from the latest version in the [releases page](https://github.com/athattayathu/ergo-delta-skin/releases) 

# Want to run it yourself?
Run `make package` to generate the delta skin in the `build/out` folder

# Project Roadmap
## V1
1. - [x] Get a better understanding of how to get "point" location from inkscape
2. - [x] Create a new skin for landscape DS that has:  
       - the DPAD in an optimal position due to frequent usage as part of navigation
       - Quick Save/Load buttons in an optimal position to avoid accidental presses
3. - [x] Test the skin in Delta
4. - [ ] Automate Release pipeline via Github Actions
