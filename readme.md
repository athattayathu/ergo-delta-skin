# An Ergonomic Skin for Delta

## Overview
I wasn't satisfied with the original Delta skin so I tried to find a more ergonomic skin to fit the Game I wanted to play... Since I didn't find anything that fit my liking, I make one myself.

# Project Roadmap

1. - [ ] Get a better understanding of how to get "point" location from inkscape
2. - [ ] Create a new skin that has:  
       - the DPAD in an optimal position due to frequent usage as part of navigation
       - Quick Save/Load buttons in an optimal position to avoid accidental presses
3. - [ ] Test the skin in Delta
4. - [ ] Get better understanding of how we can make edits to skins easier for dpad sizing
6. - [ ] see how customizable we can make the skin by using SVGs for each asset and allowing for placement in various locations on screen
